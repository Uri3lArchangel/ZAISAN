            Access to capital: Tokenization enables companies to convert assets
            into digital tokens and sell them on the market. This opens up new
            funding opportunities and creates access to a wider range of
            investors

            {" "}
            The ability to tokenize assets can increase liquidity and facilitate
            trading. Companies can thus make their assets more liquid and at the
            same time offer investors the opportunity to invest in fractions of
            these assets.

            {" "}
            Cost efficiency: The use of blockchain technology and smart
            contracts in tokenization can lead to cost savings. Automated
            processing of transactions and contracts potentially reduces
            administrative costs and reduces the need for intermediaries.

            {" "}
            Access to a wider investor audience: Tokenization allows companies
            to target investors on a global scale. Smaller investors can get on
            board more easily, which can lead to broader equity participation.

            {" "}
            The use of blockchain technology provides a transparent and i
            mmutable record of transactions. This increases investor confidence
            as they gain a clear insight into the histo ry and performance of
            tokenized assets.
